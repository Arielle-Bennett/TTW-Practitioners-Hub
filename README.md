*A project management repository for The Turing Way Practitioners Hub*

## About the Project

[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) is a flagship project of [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). 
Shared as an open source community-driven handbook on data science, the project promotes best practices for reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative research. 
To date, 400+ diverse contributors from international organisations have collaborated to develop 300+ chapters and resources, which are available across guides on reproducibility, project design, communication, collaboration, research ethics and community. 
Hosted under the [Tools, Practices and Systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) Research Programme, the project draws expertise from the institute‚Äôs Community Management, Research Application Management, Academic Skills and Research Engineering Teams.
To embed data science best practices and community expertise into different sectors, we are launching The Turing Way Practitioners Hub this year. 

The Practitioners Hub will provide a forum for cross-sector engagement, knowledge exchange and strategic collaboration with organisations across academia, research, engineering systems, government and healthcare leading data science initiatives. 
Through the involvement of domain experts from these sectors, the Practitioners Hub will enable systematic approaches for building a shared understanding of open science, reproducibility, accessibility and research ethics to enhance quality, rigour and integrity in data science and AI.


**Maintainers**

This repository is jointly developed and maintained by The Turing Way Co-Lead (Dr. Malvika Sharan), Research Project Manager (Alexandra Araujo Alvarez), Senior Research Associate (to be recruited soon) and the Research Application Manager (Jennifer Ding), all of them under the Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme at The Alan Turing Institute.
